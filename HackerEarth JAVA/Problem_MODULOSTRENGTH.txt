Alice is the teacher of a class having N students, where each student is having some personality value, given in the form of an array A. Here denotes the personality value of student, where . Alice has special integer K with her. Student i is a friend of Student j, if and only if (

). Each student's strength is equal to the number of friends he/she has. Alice needs to calculate the sum of the strength of all the students in the class. Help Alice for the same.

Note: This is a Code golf problem. You need to write code with minimum number of characters.

Input:
First line contains 2 integers N, K, denoting the number of students in the class and the special integer Alice is having respectively.
Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the personality value of each student.

Output:
Print the sum of the strength of all the students in the class.

Here, 6,11,16 are friends of each other as all will result in 1 when modulo with 5. Here each student is having strength 2. Similarly 7,12 are friends of each other, as all will result in 2 when modulo with 5. Here each student is having strength 1.

Total Strength of class is
