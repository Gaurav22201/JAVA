 Your task is to complete the function findElements() which takes the array A[] and 
its size N as inputs and return the vector sorted values denoting the elements in array 
which have at-least two greater elements than themselves.

public long[] findElements( long a[], long n)
    {
        Arrays.sort(a);
        long []arr2 = new long[(int)n-2];
        for(int i=0;i<n-2;i++){
            arr2[i] = a[i];
        } 
        return arr2;
    }
